# Control API Visibility and Subscription Availability in the Developer Portal

By default, the APIs created in the API Publisher Portal are visible to anyone (even anonymous users) who come to the Developer Portal. However, API Publishers can control this in 2 ways. The first one is they can select which users can see their APIs in the Developer Portal, and the second one is they can control which users can subscribe to their APIs.
