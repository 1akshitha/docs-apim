# Viewing API Statistics

API statistics are provided for both the API Publisher and the Developer Portal. 

From API-M Analytics 3.0.0 release onwards, Publisher and Developer Portal statistics are moved out from the Publisher and Developer portal apps.
And those can be viewed using the **dashboard** runtime of the API-M Analytics server.

For instructions on how to set up Analytics, see [Configuring APIM Analytics](../configuring-apim-analytics.md) . 
Once Analytics is set up, follow the instructions below to view statistics relevant to API Publisher and Developer Portal.

First, [invoke a few APIs](../../../ConsumeAPI/InvokeApis/InvokeApisUsingTools/invoke-an-api-using-the-integrated-api-console/) to generate traffic and see the statistics.

!!! note
      The following widgets on the API Manager statistical dashboards, display real runtime statistics even when Analytics is not set up (as described in [Configuring APIM Analytics](_Configuring_APIM_Analytics_) ).

The sections below explain how to access the statistical dashboards:

+ Log in to the Analytics Dashboard by accessing `<Protocol>://<Host>:<Port>/analytics-dashboard` (ex: [https://localhost:9643/analytics-dashboard](https://localhost:9643/analytics-dashboard)).Â 
+ After login in, you will see the **APIM Publisher** and the **APIM Developer Portal** dashboards listed.

  The availability of APIs statistics is directly related to the [Availability of APIs (health monitoring)](../../ManagingAlertsWithRealTimeAnalytics/alert-types/#availability-of-apis-api-health-monitoring) alert type. 
  
  ![](../../../assets/img/Learn/publisher-overview-overall-api-stats.png)
  
Along with the total number of stars received for each api, Top Rated Apis section of the widget displays the api creator of each api as well. 
By clicking on the filter arrow
