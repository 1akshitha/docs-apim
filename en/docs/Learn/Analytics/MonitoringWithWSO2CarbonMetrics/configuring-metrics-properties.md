# Configuring Metrics Properties

The `<APIM_HOME>/repository/conf/metrics.properties` file specifies properties that correspond to the gauges in the **Metrics Dashboard** . See the topic on [using JVM metrics](_Using_JVM_Metrics_) for details on using the metrics dashboard for JVM metrics. The level defined for a property in this file determines the extent to which the relevant gauge in the dashboard should be updated with information. The different levels that can be defined for properties are as follows:

| Level     | Description                                                                                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Off**   | Designates no informational events.                                                                            |
| **Info**  | Designates informational metric events that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level. |
| **Debug** | Designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.                     |
| **Trace** | Designates finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG.                                                  |
| **All**   | Designates all the informational events.                                                                       |

If no specific level is configured for a property in the `metrics.properties` file, the metrics root level applies. The root level is defined as shown in the following example in the `metrics.properties` file.

``` java
    metrics.rootLevel=OFF
```

If you want to change the current root level, you can also use the following command.

``` java
    -Dmetrics.rootLevel=INFO
```

The levels in `metrics.properties` file can be configured to any hierarchy. However, if the level defined for an individual property is different to the level defined for its parent in the hierarchy, the level defined for the individual property overrules that of the parent. For example, if we have `metric.level.jvm.memory=INFO` in the `<APIM_HOME>/repository/conf/metrics.properties` file, all metrics under `jvm.memory` have `INFO` as the configured level. However, if you have `metric.level.jvm.memory.heap=TRACE` , the `TRACE` level would apply for the `metric.level.jvm.memory.heap` property even though it is a child property of `jvm.memory.        `

The properties that are included in this file by default are as follows:

-   [JVM's direct and mapped buffer pools](#ConfiguringMetricsProperties-JVM'sdirectandmappedbufferpools)
-   [Class loading](#ConfiguringMetricsProperties-Classloading)
-   [GC](#ConfiguringMetricsProperties-GC)
-   [Memory](#ConfiguringMetricsProperties-Memory)

#### Viewing API specific Handler Metrics

Follow the below steps to view API specific metrics for handlers which are exposed through Dropwizard. These are timer metricsÂ which allow us to see how much time is taken for each handler.

1.  Copy the **JMX Service URL** displayed in the console at API Manager server startup.

    ``` java
            INFO - JMXServerManager JMX Service URL  : service:jmx:rmi://localhost:11111/jndi/rmi://localhost:9999/jmxrmi
    ```

2.  Go to `<JDK_HOME>/bin` . JDK\_HOME is the directory where the JDK(Java Development Kit) is installed. Find the **jconsole** executable file in the directory and run it on the command/shell prompt.

        !!! tip
    You can type **jconsole** in the command/shell prompt to run the file.


3.  In the prompted window, enter theÂ JMX Service URL copied before as a new connection. Type **admin** in both username and password fields and click **Connect** .
4.  Now [invoke an API](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM210/Quick+Start+Guide#QuickStartGuide-InvokingtheAPI) in WSO2 API Manager.

        !!! note
    Handler Metrics will only be visible when you invoke an API.


5.  Go to the **MBeans** tab in the open **jconsole** window. You can view the implemented metrics by using Dropwizard Metrics Library which starts with the **org.wso2.am** prefix.
