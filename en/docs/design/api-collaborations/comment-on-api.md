# Use the Community Features

The Publisher Portal provides several useful features to build and nurture an active community of users, for your APIs. Community features are helpful for API Consumers to collaborate and communicate with API Publisher and build up constructive conversations.

Let's see what community features are available in the Publisher Portal:

- [Comments and replies on an API](#Comment-on-an-api)
- [Community Links](#Community-Links)

#### Comment on an API

API Publishers or Creators can comment on any API that are available for them in the Publisher portal and they can build up conversation with fellow API Publishers or API Consumers. Users can add new comments or reply to any comment from either developer portal or publisher portal itself.

Let's see how to add a comment and how to reply to a comment:

1.  Log in to the Publisher Portal and click on an API.
