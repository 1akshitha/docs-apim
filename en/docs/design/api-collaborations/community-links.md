# Use the Community Features

The Developer Portal provides several useful features to build and nurture an active community of users, for your APIs. Community features are helpful for API Consumers to collaborate and communicate with API Publisher and build up constructive conversations.

Let's see what community features are available in the Developer Portal:

- [Rate an API](#rate-an-API)
- [Comments and replies on an API](#Comment-on-an-api)
- [Github and Slack URLs](#Github-and-Slack-URLs)

#### Rate an API

API ratings will give useful insights to potential API consumers on the quality and usefulness of an API. You can rate on each API version.
