# Configuring Multiple Tenants

The goal of multi-tenancy is to maximize resource sharing by allowing multiple users (tenants) to log in and use a single server/cluster at the same time, in a tenant-isolated manner. That is, each user is given the experience of using his/her own server, rather than a shared environment. Multi-tenancy ensures optimal performance of the system's resources such as memory and hardware and also secures each tenant's personal data.

You can register tenant domains using the Management Console of WSO2 products.

For common instructions on configuring multiple tenants for your WSO2 server, see [Working with Multiple Tenants](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Working+with+Multiple+Tenants) in the WSO2 Administration Guide and t o understand how multi-tenancy works with the API Store, see [Managing Tenants](_Managing_Tenants_) .
