Follow the instructions below to change the default token expiry time based on your requirements.

## Changing the default token expiration time at the global-level

!!! note
    The changes that you do here will be applied only to the new applications that you create.

### Changing the default expiration time of application access tokens

Access tokens have an expiration time, which is set to 60 minutes by default.

1. Open the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file 
2. Add or update the `app_access_token_validity` value under the `[oauth.token_validation]` section.

    ``` toml
    [oauth.token_validation]
    app_access_token_validity = 2000
    ```

### Changing the default expiration time of user access tokens

User access tokens have an expiration time, which is set to 60 minutes by default.

1. Open the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file 
2. Add or update the `user_access_token_validity` value under the `[oauth.token_validation]` section.

    ``` toml
    [oauth.token_validation]
    user_access_token_validity = 3000
    ```

### Changing the default expiration time of refresh tokens

Refresh access tokens have an expiration time, which is set to 24 hours by default.

1. Open the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.
2. Add or update the `refresh_token_validity` value under the `[oauth.token_validation]` section.

    ``` toml
    [oauth.token_validation]
    refresh_token_validity = 86400
    ```

!!! note
    Finally, your configuration will look as follows if you have configured all the above configurations.
    ``` toml
        [oauth.token_validation]
        app_access_token_validity = 2000
        user_access_token_validity = 3000
        refresh_token_validity = 86400
    ```
