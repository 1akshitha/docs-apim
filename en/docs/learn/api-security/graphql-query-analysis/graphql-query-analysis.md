GraphQL is an open-source data query & manipulation language for APIs. It provides a common interface between the client 
and the server for data fetching and manipulations.

With GraphQL queries, the client which requests data has more flexibility compared to REST where it can request any 
amount of data it wishes. This flexibility comes at a cost since now the GraphQL service might have to do complex 
operations to serve each type of query it receives. To overcome this hardship, the query needs to be analysed before 
execution. Without any protection to the backend, weâ€™ll be vulnerable to DoS attacks (due to excessive load to the 
server, database or network), which are caused by the execution of malicious and complex queries that are passed either
intentionally or unintentionally. 

Since clients have the possibility to request very complex queries, servers must be ready to handle them properly. 
**WSO2 API-Manager introduces Static Query Analyser to Secure GraphQL APIs** to address such issues.

### Static Query Analyser

Through the static query analyzer, we analyse the query and based on the previously set limitations/policy and block 
complex queries before it reaches the backend. Given below is the basic outline of the policies which are to be defined 
within the policy definition.

   - [Query Depth Limitation]({{base_path}}/learn/api-security/graphql-query-analysis/query-depth-limitation)
    
   - [Query Complexity Limitation]({{base_path}}/learn/api-security/graphql-query-analysis/query-complexity-limitation)


In order to implement this **Fine Grained Access Control-Static Query Analyser**, we introduce two new alternative fields 
to the Subscription Policy: **GraphQL Max Depth** and  **GraphQL Max Complexity**.

So Through the Subscription Policy UI in the admin portal, we can set the GraphQL Max Depth value and GraphQL Max Complexity 
values. Selecting Business Plans, you can allocate the GraphQL Max Depth and GraphQL Max Complexity values for your APIs.

Also, the policy for the custom complexity values would be as follows;

The following model shows how to use a given policy during run time:

Figure given below depicts the overall flow of API invocation - from the request made by the client to the response 
which is given back to the client.
