\[ [Pattern 1](#pattern-1-single-node-all-in-one-deployment) \] \[ [Pattern 2](#pattern-2-deployment-with-a-separate-gateway-and-separate-key-manager) \] \[ [Pattern 3](#pattern-3-fully-distributed-setup) \] \[ [Pattern 4](#pattern-4-internal-and-external-on-premise-api-management) \] \[ [Pattern 5](#pattern-5-internal-and-external-public-and-private-cloud-api-management) \]

You can use this pattern when you require a high throughput scenario that requires a shorter token lifespan.

## Pattern 3: Fully distributed setup
