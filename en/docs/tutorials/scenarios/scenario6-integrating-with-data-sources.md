# Scenario 6 - Integrating with Data Sources

## User Story

**RailCo HR department is planning to develop an HR system dashboard. Therefore, Railco wants to create REST APIS to expose their 
Employee Database as a service where users can add, delete, update and view employee details.**

With WSO2 Micro Integrator Data Services, users can Integrate with different Data Sources and decouple the data from its infrastructure. 
In other words, when you create a data service in WSO2 Micro Integrator, the data that is stored in a storage system (such as the RDBMS) 
can be exposed in the form of a service. This allows users (that may be any application or system) to access the data without interacting 
with the original source of the data.

To develop a service in Micro Integrator, you can use WSO2 Integration Studio.

Once developed, you can expose the data via API manager for secure access. For simplicity, the Dataservice is already 
developed and added in the API manager. A database has been created with dummy Employee Data which you can query and modify.

To invoke the API from API Manager,

1. Go to [https://localhost:9443/devportal/](https://localhost:9443/devportal/) Dev portal and select **RailCo** tenant domain. This will redirect you to RailCoâ€™s developer portal.
2. Sign in with a RailCo tenant, developer portal user. (tom@railco.com)
3. Click on RailCoEmployeeAPI and click subscribe using a policy and generate the access token.
4. After that you can try out the CRUD operations on the EmployeeAPI.

For eg, you can try out the following Curl request.

```
curl -k -X GET 'https://localhost:8243/t/railco.com/operations/data/employees/1.0.0/employees/2' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <Access Token>'

```
